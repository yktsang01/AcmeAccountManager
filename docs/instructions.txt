Problem statement:

Story 1) As a customer I would like to get the balance of my account

Story 2) As a customer I would like to be able to transfer an amount in HKD from one account to another account

 

Assumptions:

- Name of the company is acmebank, and the name of the service you are implementing is account-manager (use those names for your packages)

- Those accounts already exists: 12345678, and 88888888. Each of them have an initial balance of 1,000,000 HKD

- As a customer I should be able to get balance of those accounts, and transfer money between those accounts

- All amounts are in HKD

 

Technology stack:

- we want a rest api

- programming language preference with Java or Kotlin

- preference with Springboot framework, which is the framework Mox is now using

- provide a simple way to build the project in one click (preference gradle or maven)

- Use h2 database so the balance can be persisted on disk in a local file (if I restart the service I should be able to get the last balance of the accounts)

- Use a public repository (like github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc) to commit your source code

 

Evaluation criteria:

- solution must build

- solution must do what is asked

- solution must follow best practices

 

Advices

- Don't overengineer only because it is an interview. Keep it simple, as we don't want you to spend days on this assessment

- Don't overengineer the test neither only because it is an interview. Do right amount of test to make you confident your code is working and ready for production

- Pretend it is a real life working in your company. How will you handle those 2 stories prioritized in current sprint?

- You can take as much time as you want, but earlier you submit it, earlier we will process your case

 

Submitting your solution

- Commit your source code in a public repository of your choice (example: github, gitlab, bitbucket)

- Make sure I can open the project in IntelliJ (if you choose java language, should be ok if you use gradle or maven)

- Make sure you didn't use any of those names in your code before you commit: mox, moxbank, standard chartered, sc, scb, etc.

- Please submit your solution by REPLY ALL in this email
